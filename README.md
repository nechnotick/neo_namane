## Education
- MSc in Physics (Observational Astrophysics)
  - University: Rhodes University
  - Year: 2024
  - Abstract: This study is aimed at being an overview and investigation of the behaviour and morphology of radio quiet (RQ) active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the radio and optical/near-infrared (NIR) bands. It is hoped that a concise description of the relation that exists between accretion activity and star formation (SF) will be achieved through utilization of multi-wavelength astronomy analysis. This analysis includes the processing of data acquired from the MeerKAT International GHz Tiered Extragalactic Exploration survey (MIGHTEE), the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT), the Hyper Suprime Camera (HSC) mounted on the Subaru telescope and the VISTA telescope. In this thesis, several targets were observed using SALT spectroscopy, but a redshift of only one of them was obtained. Lastly, it was established that for the sample of RQ AGN studied, the AGN contribute a large fraction of the radio emission observed.
- Selection Procedure: Color-magnitude plot of AGN via optical/NIR scheme. AGN candidates as data points, black box highlights quasar candidates. Quasar track (green dotted line with redshift steps) from White et al. [2015] aids classification. Grey line separates stellar sources (left) from 1384 AGN candidates (right), leaving 42 stellar sources. Red lines assist in AGN population count. ![Selection Procedure](/img/gJKs.png)
- Main Results: AGN sample with 516 candidates - Two SFR estimates from different parts of the spectrum. Radio SFR from MIGHTEE data, optical/NIR SFR from SALT dataset. Red dashed line for star-forming galaxies, blue dashed line for 3:2 AGN radio to SF emission ratio (60% AGN, 40% SF). ![Main Results](/img/IRRC.png)
- MSc in Physics (Theoretical Cosmology)
  - University: North West University
  - Year: 2019
  - Abstract: Quantum theory and General Relativity are two of the most fundamental theories in Theoretical
Physics. But so far, their successes rest only in their own realms of reality, namely the very small and
the very large, respectively. In this work, current attempts in unifying the two theories within the framework of Quantum Gravity, and their subsequent applications to Quantum Cosmology will be reviewed. In analysing the basis afforded to both Quantum Mechanics and Cosmology, an investigation of techniques aimed at quantizing gravity is followed. The motivation for this work stems from the advancements made in Quantum Electrodynamics, in which Electromagnetism was successfully described relativistically in terms of the Special Theory of Relativity. This essentially proves the viability of the many histories approach and the numerous other means of universal quantization, in which the decoherence from quantum mechanical theory is explained through the explicit definition
of what the semi-classical limit entails within a spherically symmetric and homogeneous universe. To deal with the inherent problem of time, a decomposition of spacetime into 3N spatial dimensions and one temporal one gives rise to the use of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, which is effectively in existence to describe the relation that the three-metrics have with a self-interacting environment known as a superspace. In this work, as an application to studies in Quantum Cosmology, an investigation of a non-relativistic quantum mechanical procedure during the radiation and matter dominated epochs is made within the context of f(R) gravitation.
